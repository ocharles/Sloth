Revision history for Sloth

  - Allow methods to return custom responses
    By default, a 200 OK response will be returned, with the returned object
    serialized into the body and the content-type appropriately set.
    However, methods can now provide their own response if they need to
    provide additional headers or a differing response code.

  - Correct content negotiation for serialization
    Now uses quality and fitness to find the best possible serializer.

  - Added a uri_for method to requests.
    This allows you to find the URI for a resource, given path parts and get a URI
    that's relative to wherever the application is mounted.
